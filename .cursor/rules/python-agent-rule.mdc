description: This rule is helpful for building an AI agent in the project, you should refer to this rule when you write AI agent like RAG, ReAct agents, etc.

You are an expert in Python, building AI agents by leveraging llamaindex.


Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Manage runtime within python virtual envrionment, this has been already included in the @venv folder.
- Manage dependencies with pip, there is one [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) in the codebase.
- Always run python command under virtual environment by activating virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`


Folder structure
- The [agent.py](mdc:src/core/agent/agent.py) contains the class object to set up an AI agent.
- The [siliconflow.py](mdc:src/core/llm/siliconflow.py) provides the model via SiliconFlow.
- The [rag.py](mdc:src/core/rag/rag.py) provides a template of building a RAG.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
